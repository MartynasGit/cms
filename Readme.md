For app to run we need PHP interpreter(XAMPP), MySQL Workbench.

- Install "Composer" in C:\xampp\htdocs
- Clone repository inside "htdocs" folder.
- git clone https://github.com/MartynasGit/cms.git
- Open cloned folder and run git bash. Type "php ../composer.phar install".
- Open "MySQL Workbench". Create connection with ussername: "root" and empty password. (if you wish to have one add here and change config.ini file's section called "db_password" )
- Open connection. Then open "Administration" tab and click "Data Import/Restore".
- Select "Import from Self-Contained File" and select "dump.sql" file from cloned repository folder.
- Press "Start Import"
- To open page as client: example http://localhost/cms/

**IMPORTANT !!**
**Change _config.ini.example_ file name to _config.ini_**

Also if your cloned aplication directory is not like in my example, change "app_prefix" on "config.ini" file to match your folder route accordingly.
