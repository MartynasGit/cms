## Install and how to open.

For app to run we need PHP interpreter(XAMPP), MySQL Workbench.

- Find where XAMPP is installed on your device and open "htdocs" folder. Potentialy in "C:\xampp\htdocs".
- Install "Composer" in C:\xampp\htdocs
- Clone repository inside "htdocs" folder.
- git clone https://github.com/MartynasGit/cms.git
- Open cloned folder and run git bash. Type "php ../composer.phar install".
- Open "MySQL Workbench". Create connection with ussername: "root" and empty password. (if you wish to have one add here and change in file called bootstrap.php)
- Open connection. Then open "Administration" tab and click "Data Import/Restore".
- Select "Import from Self-Contained File" and select "dump.sql" file from cloned repository folder.
- Press "Start Import"
- To open page go browser and type localhost/(directory here) example: http://localhost/cms/
- To open admin: example http://localhost/cms/Admin 
- Ussername: Admin
- Password: Admin

IMPORTANT !! If your page directory is not like in my example, change "prefix" in index.php to match your folder route accordingly.
